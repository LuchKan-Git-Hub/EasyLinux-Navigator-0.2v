# EasyLinux Navigator | 0.2v

A beginner-friendly Linux terminal navigator and open-source Python project.

EasyLinux Navigator is designed to help newcomers explore and manage files and directories in Linux without memorizing commands. It allows you to:

- **View the current working directory**
- **List files and folders**
- **Create folders or text files**
- **Move between directories and save favorite paths for quick access**

But it’s not just a helper tool—it’s also an **open-source Python project**! The code is clean, modular, and easy to read, making it a great resource for anyone learning Python, file system operations, and basic scripting practices.

Whether you’re learning Linux or Python, EasyLinux Navigator gives you a hands-on way to experiment with real code while improving your terminal skills.

# New Features in 0.2v 🛠️

The 0.2 update introduces a set of improvements designed to make EasyLinux Navigator smoother, clearer, and even more beginner-friendly:

- **Time management**  
  Basic timestamp handling has been added, giving users a clearer view of when actions or changes take place during their session.

- **Enhanced saving system**  
  Favorites and settings are now stored more reliably, making it easier to return to your preferred directories without extra setup.

These updates are part of the project’s ongoing growth. Additional improvements and hotfixes are already planned, and new refinements will continue to roll out as the tool evolves.
